üß© Overview

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations (SOC) automation system, built to demonstrate how a modern organization can:

Detect vulnerabilities and incidents

Automatically assess their severity

Trigger contextual, risk-based responses

Notify the right channels for immediate action

It bridges technical execution (Python automation, DevSecOps) with leadership-level visibility (incident reporting, risk triage, audit trail creation).

Each folder mirrors how enterprise SOC and GRC teams organize automation pipelines, ensuring scalability, auditability, and maintainability.

üö® Phase 1 ‚Äì Vulnerability Detection & Configuration

Goal: Simulate an enterprise vulnerability management workflow.

‚úÖ Key Features

Scanners integrated: QualysScanner, MicrosoftVMScanner (simulated)

Secure configuration: Secrets handled via .env (never pushed to Git)

Automatic target discovery: Loads targets from config

Example .env (local only):

QUALYS_API_KEY=dummy_key_123
MS_VM_TOKEN=dummy_token_456
TARGETS_FILE=targets.txt
REPORTS_DIR=reports/


Output:
üóÇÔ∏è reports/alerts.json ‚Äì Normalized vulnerability findings across all scanners.

‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2 ‚Äì Automated Response & Notification

Goal: Automate triage, containment, and communication based on alert severity.

üß† Logic Flow

Parse Findings

Converts vendor scan results into structured JSON (alerts.json).

Respond Intelligently

High Severity ‚Üí Quarantine host, revoke keys, notify IR lead

Medium Severity ‚Üí Open remediation ticket, schedule patching

Low Severity ‚Üí Log and monitor

All actions logged in response_log.json

Notify Channels

Console summary (default)

Slack / Microsoft Teams via webhook (optional)

Example Console Output
=== INCIDENT RESPONSE AUTOMATION: PHASE 2 ===
[+] Configuration loaded:
QUALYS_API_KEY: dummy_key_123
MS_VM_TOKEN: dummy_token_456

--- Alerts from Qualys for http://example.com ---
[High] SQL Injection vulnerability (Qualys)
[Medium] Missing security header (Qualys)

[+] Wrote normalized alerts -> reports/alerts.json
[+] Response actions logged -> reports/response_log.json
[+] Summary: {'High': 1, 'Medium': 1, 'Low': 0, 'Unknown': 0}

‚úÖ Phase 2 complete ‚Äî response + notifications simulated.

üß∞ Technologies Used

‚ö° GitHub CI Integration (Optional)

.github/workflows/ir-sim.yml automatically runs your simulation on every commit or manual trigger:

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:


Artifacts produced:

alerts.json

response_log.json

Both are uploaded to the workflow run for easy audit trail collection.

üßæ Output Reports
File	Purpose
reports/alerts.json	All findings normalized by risk level
reports/response_log.json	Action logs for remediation & triage
reports/audit.md (future)	Executive summary for compliance reviews
