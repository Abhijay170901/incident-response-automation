🛡️ Incident Response Automation

Automating Detection → Response → Notification for Cybersecurity Operations

🧩 Overview

This project simulates a real-world Security Operations (SOC) automation system, built to demonstrate how a modern organization can:

Detect vulnerabilities and incidents

Automatically assess their severity

Trigger contextual, risk-based responses

Notify the right channels for immediate action

It bridges technical execution (Python automation, DevSecOps) with leadership-level visibility (incident reporting, risk triage, audit trail creation).

Each folder mirrors how enterprise SOC and GRC teams organize automation pipelines, ensuring scalability, auditability, and maintainability.

🚨 Phase 1 – Vulnerability Detection & Configuration

Goal: Simulate an enterprise vulnerability management workflow.

✅ Key Features

Scanners integrated: QualysScanner, MicrosoftVMScanner (simulated)

Secure configuration: Secrets handled via .env (never pushed to Git)

Automatic target discovery: Loads targets from config

Example .env (local only):

QUALYS_API_KEY=dummy_key_123
MS_VM_TOKEN=dummy_token_456
TARGETS_FILE=targets.txt
REPORTS_DIR=reports/


Output:
🗂️ reports/alerts.json – Normalized vulnerability findings across all scanners.

⚙️ Phase 2 – Automated Response & Notification

Goal: Automate triage, containment, and communication based on alert severity.

🧠 Logic Flow

Parse Findings

Converts vendor scan results into structured JSON (alerts.json).

Respond Intelligently

High Severity → Quarantine host, revoke keys, notify IR lead

Medium Severity → Open remediation ticket, schedule patching

Low Severity → Log and monitor

All actions logged in response_log.json

Notify Channels

Console summary (default)

Slack / Microsoft Teams via webhook (optional)

Example Console Output
=== INCIDENT RESPONSE AUTOMATION: PHASE 2 ===
[+] Configuration loaded:
QUALYS_API_KEY: dummy_key_123
MS_VM_TOKEN: dummy_token_456

--- Alerts from Qualys for http://example.com ---
[High] SQL Injection vulnerability (Qualys)
[Medium] Missing security header (Qualys)

[+] Wrote normalized alerts -> reports/alerts.json
[+] Response actions logged -> reports/response_log.json
[+] Summary: {'High': 1, 'Medium': 1, 'Low': 0, 'Unknown': 0}

✅ Phase 2 complete — response + notifications simulated.
